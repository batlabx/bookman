3. **Deduplicate** â Checks against existing entries; increments `times_recommended` for repeats
4. **Enrich** â Fetches Goodreads rating and generates Amazon search links
5. **Categorize** â Auto-tags each book into a thematic category
6. **Commit** â Pushes updated `books.json`, `books.md`, and `trends.md` to this repo
